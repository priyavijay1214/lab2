# **Introduction**

The topic of my proposed project is an exploratory analysis of the 2022 Greater Austin Music Census to investigate demographics, economic outcomes, and perceptions of the Austin music ecosystem. The Austin music community is a major cultural and economic asset. The 2022 Music Census captures rich respondent-level data (demographics, income and employment characteristics, perceptions about the scene, and DEI questions). Analyzing this dataset will allow me to study how factors such as location, sector, and demographics relate to economic outcomes (e.g., income, number of shows) and to perceptions of the local music scene, topics that are relevant for policy and community planning. Research Questions:

RQ1: Do respondents who live farther from downtown Austin report fewer opportunities (proxied by distance and work location)?

RQ2: Are perceptions of the music scene (through sector and community participation) associated with experience or geography?

# **Date Preparation**

I began by importing the dataset into R and simplifying the column names for easier use. I then selected the key variables related to location, sector, and experience. Two numeric columns --- Residence Distance from Downtown in miles and Years Experience --- were converted to numeric data types, while categorical variables such as County of Residence, Primary Music Ecosystem Sector, and City of Austin Resident were converted to factors.

Next, I created two new variables:

distance_cat, which groups respondents into 0--5 miles, 6--15 miles, and 16+ miles from downtown Austin.

exp_cat, which groups Years Experience into \<3 years, 3--9 years, and 10+ years.

A main challenge I faced was that some entries in the Residence Distance from Downtown column contained text or blanks instead of numbers, which caused conversion errors. To resolve this, I converted the column to numeric using as.numeric() and handled NA values appropriately before analysis.

# **Variable Descriptions**

```{r variable_table}
# Create a small data frame (table) with variable names, types, and descriptions
var_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("county", "distance_miles", "distance_cat", "city_resident",
               "sector", "years_exp", "exp_cat", "work_location",
               "music_edu", "community_part"),
  Type = c("Categorical", "Numeric", "Categorical", "Categorical",
           "Categorical", "Numeric", "Categorical", "Categorical",
           "Categorical", "Categorical"),
  Description = c(
    "County of residence (e.g., Travis, Williamson, Bastrop)",
    "Respondent’s reported distance from downtown Austin (in miles)",
    "Grouped distance variable (0–5, 6–15, 16+ miles)",
    "Indicates whether the respondent lives in the City of Austin",
    "Primary music ecosystem sector (Creative, Business, etc.)",
    "Years of experience in the music ecosystem",
    "Grouped experience levels (<3, 3–9, 10+ years)",
    "Typical work setting (venue, studio, remote, etc.)",
    "Formal music education (Yes/No)",
    "Participation in community or business organizations"
  )
)

# **Univariate Analyses**

```{r}
# 1. Distance histogram
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_miles)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#4682B4", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Distance from Downtown", x = "Distance (miles)", y = "Count")

# 2. Sector distribution
ggplot(df, aes(x = sector)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#8FBC8F") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Primary Music Ecosystem Sector", x = "Sector", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# 3. Distance category counts
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_cat)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#FFB347") +
  labs(title = "Respondents by Distance Category", x = "Distance Category", y = "Count")

# 4. Experience distribution
ggplot(df, aes(x = years_exp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, fill = "#9370DB", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Years of Experience", x = "Years", y = "Count")
```

The median distance is about `r round(median_distance, 1)` miles. Most respondents live within 15 miles of downtown, showing high centralization of music professionals.
Years of experience vary widely, with clusters under 10 years and over 20 years.
Creative sectors appear to dominate participation.

# **Bivariate Analyses**

```{r}
# 1. Experience vs Distance scatter
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_miles, y = years_exp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#2E8B57") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Experience vs Distance from Downtown", x = "Distance (miles)", y = "Years of Experience")

# 2. Boxplot of Experience by Distance Category
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_cat, y = years_exp)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#FFA07A") +
  labs(title = "Years of Experience by Distance Category", x = "Distance Category", y = "Years Experience")

# 3. Bar plot of Sector by Distance Category
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_cat, fill = sector)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Sector Composition Across Distance Categories", x = "Distance Category", y = "Proportion")

# 4. Multivariate scatter: Experience vs Distance colored by Sector, sized by Community Participation
ggplot(df, aes(x = distance_miles, y = years_exp, color = sector, size = as.numeric(as.factor(community_part)))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Multivariate: Experience vs Distance by Sector and Participation",
       x = "Distance (miles)", y = "Years Experience")
```

There appears to be a weak relationship between distance and experience. The boxplot suggests that highly experienced individuals are slightly more likely to live closer to downtown. Sector composition varies by geography: creative roles dominate the core, while business-related roles appear more suburban. The multivariate plot shows overlap among sectors; larger points (greater community participation) cluster near downtown.

# **Choice Element**

In this report, I included several of the optional choice elements listed in the project instructions. First, I enabled a floating table of contents in the R Markdown YAML header to make it easier to navigate across sections in the HTML output. Second, I created two new variables, distance_cat and exp_cat, which group continuous measures of distance and years of experience into meaningful categories for comparison. Third, I included multiple inline R codes throughout the report to display dynamic values such as the total number of respondents and the median distance from downtown Austin. Fourth, I added two working hyperlinks in the introduction that link directly to the official data source and an image citation. Finally, I created a multivariate visualization in the Bivariate Analyses section showing how distance, experience, and sector relate to one another, with point size representing community participation. These elements help make the report more informative, interactive, and visually organized for readers.

# **Conclusion**
Most respondents live within 15 miles of downtown Austin, confirming geographic centralization of the local music workforce. Experience does not strongly depend on distance, though those closest to downtown report slightly higher average tenure. Sector distribution suggests creative roles dominate the city core, while business-related roles are distributed more broadly.

Future Research:
Future work could incorporate actual income or gig frequency data, or merge this dataset with venue density and housing cost data to explore geographic equity and access in Austin’s music scene.
